    "## Reading Files in Python\n",
    "* To read a text file in Python, you follow these steps:\n",
    "* First, Open a text file for reading by using the open() function.\n",
    "* 2nd Step : read the text file using read(), readline(), readlines() method of the file object.\n",
    "* 3rd step: close the file using the close() method which frees up resources and ensures consistency across different Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:-\n",
    "* 1. writable() - Returns whether the file can be written or not.\n",
    "* 2. readable() - Returns whether the file can be  read or not.\n",
    "* 3. read() - returns the file content\n",
    "* 4. readline() - Returns one line from the file.\n",
    "* 5. readlines() - returns a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "* 6. write() - writes the specfied strings to the file.\n",
    "* 7. writelines() - writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "* 8. close() - close the file.\n",
    "* 9. flush() - flushes the internal buffer\n",
    "* 10. tell() - returns the current file.\n",
    "* 11. truncate - resizes the file specified."
