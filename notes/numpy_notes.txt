Numpy is a python library

Numpy stands for numerical python.

Travis Oliphant developed numpy library in the year 2005.

Problem faced by poeple when they only used python for data analysis

   1. It was very slow when working on large datasets like weather, stock market data
   2. People had to use loops to work on this datasets which was time consuming 
   3. They used lists but the lists are not memory efficient, not suitable for large data

Numpy was built to:
                  1. To handle large amount of numbers in little to no time (like millions of rows of data).
                  2. To overcome the slowness of lists and loops, and invented special arrays

Special arrays where super fast and memory efficient.They are advanced lists

Benefits of Numpy: 
1. Speed is 50 - 100x more than lists
2. Uses less memory
3. Easy math operations
4. Used in AI, DS and ML, stock market & finance, medical research, and image processing.
